# DTA-Prediction-with-Graph-Neural-Network
This repository contains code and resources for replicatin the work described in the paper "Drugâ€“Target Affinity Prediction using Graph Neural Network and Contact Maps" (RSC Advances, 2020). In this project, I changed the protein representation by using contact maps derived from AlphaFold-generated PDB files.
